# Limitations

Some of the known limitations of this tool are discussed below.

## Relationship between hydrological parameters

The tool outputs a number of hydrological parameters including mean annual runoff (mm/yr), mean annual precipitation (mm/yr) and evapotranspiration (mm/yr).

Please note, that the parameters provided by this tool do not meet the expected constraint:

> [Mean annual runoff = Mean annual precipitation + Mean annual evapotranspiration] ‚ùå

This constraint is not met as each parameter is obtained from a different GIS data source, each of which differ with respect to temporal resolution and coverage, spatial resolution and modelling methodology.:
