# c_climate_zone (Predominant climate [catchment])

The predominant (modal) climate zone of the catchment area is coded using
the following Köppen-Geiger classes from data published by Beck et al. [2018]:

    1:  Af   Tropical, rainforest                 
    2:  Am   Tropical, monsoon                    
    3:  Aw   Tropical, savannah                   
    4:  BWh  Arid, desert, hot                    
    5:  BWk  Arid, desert, cold                   
    6:  BSh  Arid, steppe, hot                     
    7:  BSk  Arid, steppe, cold                    
    8:  Csa  Temperate, dry summer, hot summer     
    9:  Csb  Temperate, dry summer, warm summer   
    10: Csc  Temperate, dry summer, cold summer    
    11: Cwa  Temperate, dry winter, hot summer    
    12: Cwb  Temperate, dry winter, warm summer

    14: Cfa  Temperate, no dry season, hot summer  
    15: Cfb  Temperate, no dry season, warm summer 
    16: Cfc  Temperate, no dry season, cold summer
    17: Dsa  Cold, dry summer, hot summer
