======================================
Welcome to GeoCARET's documentation
======================================

.. _GeoCARET: https://github.com/Reservoir-Research/geocaret
.. _GEE: https://earthengine.google.com/

Version: |version|

GeoCARET_ is a command line Python tool for delineating and analysing catchments and reservoirs.

.. code-block:: rst

   Pronounced geokærət as in bʌkət or geokæreɪ as in bʊˈkeɪ.

It relies on Google Earth Engine (`GEE`_) - Google's cloud-based platform developed for planetary-scale environmental analysis. GeoCARET_ uses Google Earth Engine as a backend for performing geometry operations and data processing and as a database of global spatial data in the form of GIS layers. 
GeoCARET_ performs its computations on global spatial datasets available in `GEE`_ and additionally relies on several private assets. 
We have made these assets accessible for analysis by uploading them to a dedicated `GEE`_ asset folder.

.. important::
   The users need to request permission from us to use the dedicated private assets before they can make successful runs with GeoCARET_. 
   Please refer to the :doc:`installation/index` for further instructions.
   To request access to those assets please send email to: `Tomasz Janus - Email 1 <mailto:tomasz.k.janus@gmail.com?subject=%5BGeoCARET%5D%20Request%20Asset%20Access>`__ or `Tomasz Janus - Email 2 <mailto:tjanus.heet@gmail.com?subject=%5BGeoCARET%5D%20Request%20Asset%20Access>`__ with your email address registered with the Google Earth Engine.
