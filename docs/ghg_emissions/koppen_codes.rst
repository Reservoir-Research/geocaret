Köppen-Geiger climate zone classification
=========================================

The predominant (modal) climate zone of the catchments is coded using Köppen-Geiger classification published in [Beck2018]_ and given below. 
The climate zone for each reservoir/catchment is stored in the variable ``c_climate_zone``. 
The below table is reproduced from the supplementary materials/associated data in [Beck2018]_.
