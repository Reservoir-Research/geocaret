This software and documentation would not have been possible without the joint effort of several people.

In particular, we would like to acknowledge **Dr. Kamilla Harding-Kopec (PhD)** for starting GeoCARET_ and writing most of the initial source-code (in fact all of the code in its current working form in the ``main`` branch of the GeoCARET_'s repository), and for contributing the bulk of the text in this documentation.

We would also like to acknowledge **Dr. James Sinnott (PhD)** for creating the Docker image and for his contribution to this documentation, including writing the pages related to the use of Docker and setting up projects on `Google Cloud`_.
