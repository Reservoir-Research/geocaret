GeoCARET_ relies on several private assets not available in `Google Earth Engine`_. You must be given access to these assets before you can run GeoCARET_.

Request access to the GeoCARET private assets
---------------------------------------------

To request access to those assets please send email to:
`tomasz.k.janus@gmail.com <mailto:tomasz.k.janus@gmail.com?subject=%5BGeoCARET%5D%20Request%20Asset%20Access>`__
or
`tjanus.heet@gmail.com <mailto:tjanus.heet@gmail.com?subject=%5BGeoCARET%5D%20Request%20Asset%20Access>`__
with the email address your registered with `Google Earth Engine`_.

You will be notified by email when the permission is granted. Once the permission is granted, you will not be able to see the assets in your Earth Engine Graphical User Interface (GUI) but you will be able to access them programmatically via Earth Engine Code Editor and, what follows, GeoCARET_ will be able to access those assets when performing its analysis.
