# Hydrosheds Flow Accumulation
# This flow accumulation dataset defines the amount of upstream area (in number
# of cells) draining into each cell. The drainage direction layer is used to
# define which cells flow into the target cell. The number of accumulated cells
# is essentially a measure of the upstream catchment area. However, since the
# cell size of the HydroSHEDS data set depends on latitude, the cell
# accumulation value cannot directly be translated into drainage areas in square
# kilometers. Values range from 1 at topographic highs (river sources) to very
# large numbers (on the order of millions of cells) at the mouths of large
# rivers.
# This dataset is at 15 arc-second resolution.
