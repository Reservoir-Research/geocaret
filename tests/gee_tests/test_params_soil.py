"""
Test module for soil characteristics and DOC export calculations.

This module contains a series of unit tests designed to validate the accuracy of soil-related 
calculations within the GeoCARET system. Each test compares calculated values from the GeoCARET 
system with known ground truth values to ensure correctness.

The tests cover various soil characteristics and DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon) export metrics, 
including:

- Mean soil organic carbon stocks
- Mean soil organic carbon content (g/kg)
- Mean soil nitrogen content (g/kg)
- Bulk soil density (kg/dm³)
- Total DOC export
- Strata-weighted molar nitrogen and carbon content

Tests are conducted using data from specific feature collections stored in Google Earth Engine 
(EE) and involve comparing GeoCARET calculations with manually verified reference values. The 
results are logged for each test, providing information on the calculated values, reference 
values, differences, and percentage differences.

Modules tested:
- `mean_soil_oc_stocks`
- `mean_soil_oc_content`
- `mean_soil_nitrogen_content`
- `mean_soil_bdod`
- `total_doc_export`
- `mean_strata_weighted_mol_n`
- `mean_strata_weighted_mol_c`

Fixtures used:
- `get_logger`: A pytest fixture used to obtain a logger instance for logging test results.

Assertions:
- Calculated values are expected to match reference values within a specified tolerance, 
  typically within 0.05% relative error.

Each test function follows a similar pattern:
1. Import necessary functions and data.
2. Define test input and expected results.
3. Perform calculations and compare them to expected results.
4. Log results and assert that the calculated values are within the acceptable range.

Example usage:
    pytest -v test_soil_characteristics.py
