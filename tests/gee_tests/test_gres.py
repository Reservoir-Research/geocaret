"""
This module contains test cases for various functions from the `heet_params` package.
These functions are designed to calculate environmental and hydrological parameters
for specific geographical features such as catchments and reservoirs. The tests
compare the outputs of these functions against ground truth values to ensure accuracy.

The tests in this module include:
- `test_mean_slope_perc_gres`: Tests the mean slope percentage calculation for a specific catchment.
- `test_mghr_gres`: Tests the MGHR (Mean Groundwater Hydraulic Radius) calculation for a specific reservoir.
- `test_mean_annual_runoff_mm_gres`: Tests the mean annual runoff calculation for a specific catchment.
- `test_population_gres`: Tests the population count and density calculations for a specific catchment.
- `test_maximum_depth_alt1_gres`: Tests the maximum depth calculation for a specific reservoir.
- `test_mean_depth_gres`: Tests the mean depth calculation for a specific reservoir.

Some tests are skipped because they depend on different data sources or have underlying differences in methodology
that make direct comparisons invalid.
