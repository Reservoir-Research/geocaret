# Repository of tests for geocaret.

We differentiate between two test classes: `gee tests` and `offline tests`.
`gee tests` test various functionalities of functions and methods deployed on Google Earth Engine. They require user authentication, setting up a working project folder and internet connection. The users can also set up a special account only for testing.
`offline tests` test software functionalities that are executed on the local machine.
